Wotchd is based on a redesign of Twitter.  
Is an application to share Wotchd about books, politics, health etc - anything that you can share Wotchd about with people who follow you.  
  
Additionally to the requirements, I added the following features :  
  - User can check Likes to the Wotchd  
  - Users are presented in 4 modes   
    - All  
    - Most Friendly, those who follow many users  
    - Most Popular, those who are followed by many users  
    - Protagonists, those who have created many Wotchd  
  - Links are everywhere, to users, to Wotchd, to followings apply

The project creates a database which holds 4 tables:

    - Users : Is the table containing the users' data  
      - Fields :  
        - string:   username  
        - string:   fullname 
        - datetime: created_at  
        - datetime: update_at  

    - Wotchd : is the table containing the Wotchd' data  
      - Fields:  
        - text:     text  
        - integer:  author_id  
        - datetime: created_at  
        - datetime: update_at  

    - Followings : Is the table that tracks users followings  
      - Fields  
        - integer: follower_id  
        - integer: followed_id  

    - Likes : Is the table that contains the users' likes on the Wotchd  
      - Fields  
        - integer: opinion_id  
        - integer: user_id  

Additionally 2 tables are created by the ActiveStorage to keep links to the users' images

  - active_storage_attachments
  - active_storage_blobs

<hr/>

## N+1 Problem

  The n+1 problem is encountered in this project into multiple case.  
  In order to avoid server's overhead, in some cases it has been solved by using aggregated SQL statements and in some other scopes of models.  

  #### Examples in Class User

  #### Aggregation examples

  ```

      def self.sort_by_friendly
        User.find_by_sql("SELECT users.id, users.username, users.fullname,
                                  count(flds.id) fd
                          FROM users
                          LEFT JOIN followings flds ON users.id = flds.follower_id
                          GROUP BY users.id, users.username, users.fullname
                          ORDER BY fd DESC")
      end

      def self.sort_by_popular
        User.find_by_sql("SELECT users.id, users.username, users.fullname,
                                  count(flrs.id) fr
                          FROM users
                          LEFT JOIN followings flrs ON users.id = flrs.followed_id
                          GROUP BY users.id, users.username, users.fullname
                          ORDER BY fr DESC")
      end

      def self.protagonists
        User.find_by_sql("SELECT users.id, users.username, users.fullname,
                                  count(Wotchd.id) Wotchd_count
                          FROM users
                          LEFT JOIN Wotchd ON users.id = Wotchd.author_id
                          GROUP BY users.id, users.username, users.fullname
                          ORDER BY Wotchd_count DESC")
      end

  ```
<hr/>

  #### Scope example

```
    scope :to_follow, ->(user) { where('id NOT IN (?)', user_followed(user)).filter { |f| f.id != user.id } }
```
